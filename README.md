# Interactive To-Do List, v0.2.1

====

Description:
* A simple program for creating, editing, saving, and loading a to-do list. Created for the Ruby "final project" on Codecadamy.

Requirements:
* Ruby 2.3.0 or later. INSTALL THIS FIRST!
* Important note: when installing Ruby using Rubyinstaller, make sure to "add Ruby executables to your PATH" during setup. This ensures the "ruby" command can be used.

How to run:
* Look for a file called "run.cmd" and double-click it. The program will start automatically.
* If this does not work for any reason, you can run .

Q&As

Does the program work on Mac OS?
* Probably not, since it hasn't been tested for Mac OS yet. Feel free to do so if you like!

Where and how does the program save my To-Do Lists?
* The lists are saved as text files (.txt), in the "data" subfolder.

Can I import a list into the program externally?
* Yes. Write and save a text file (.txt) with each task on its own line, then place it in the "data" folder; this is where the program looks for saved lists. Do NOT number the tasks, as the program will do this automatically when you use the 'show' command from the main menu.
